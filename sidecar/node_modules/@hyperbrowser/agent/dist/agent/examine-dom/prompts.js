Provide an action for this element such as ${supportedActions.join(", ")}, or any other playwright locator method. Remember that to users, buttons and links look the same in most cases.
If the action is completely unrelated to a potential action to be taken on the page, return an empty array.
ONLY return one action. If multiple actions are relevant, return the most relevant one.
For scroll actions (scrollToElement, scrollToPercentage, nextChunk, prevChunk), prefer elements marked as "scrollable" in their role. These have been automatically detected as scrollable containers. If no scrollable elements are available, choose the html element as a fallback.
Use scrollToElement (no arguments) when the request is to reveal a specific section or component. Use scrollToPercentage (with a percentage argument like "50%" or "75%") only when the user explicitly mentions a relative position on the page.
If the user is asking to scroll to the next chunk/previous chunk, choose the nextChunk/prevChunk method. No arguments are required here.
If the action implies a key press, e.g., 'press enter', 'press a', 'press space', etc., always choose the press method with the appropriate key as argument — e.g. 'a', 'Enter', 'Space'. Do not choose a click action on an on-screen keyboard. Capitalize the first character like 'Enter', 'Tab', 'Escape' only for special keys.
If the action implies choosing an option from a dropdown, AND the corresponding element is a 'select' element, choose the selectOptionFromDropdown method. The argument should be the text of the option to select.
If the action implies choosing an option from a dropdown, and the corresponding element is NOT a 'select' element, choose the click method.`;
